# Stage 1: Build the application
FROM node:19-alpine as builder

# Set the working directory in the container
WORKDIR /app

# Copy package.json and package-lock.json (if available) to the working directory
COPY package*.json ./

# Install dependencies
RUN npm install

# Copy the rest of the application code to the working directory
COPY . .

# Build the application (assuming you have a build script in package.json)
RUN npm run build

# Stage 2: Serve the app using Nginx
FROM nginx:alpine

# Copy the build output from the builder stage into the Nginx html directory
COPY --from=builder /app/dist /usr/share/nginx/html

# Expose port 80 to the outside world
EXPOSE 80
